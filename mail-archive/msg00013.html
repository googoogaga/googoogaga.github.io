This is pretty vital. :-)
 
&gt; Also: may I ask why the type system was moved away from prototypes?

I participated in these discussions, and I'll try to summarize some of
the main points for you.  Jonathan may want to correct me here.  I only
contributed a small amount of code to Goo, and none of my statements
should be taken as anything more than personal opinions.

1. &lt;foo&gt; is typically not an instance of &lt;foo&gt;.

We found that--in most of our programs--that the prototype for class
&lt;foo&gt; typically had several missing fields.  These were filled in by
individual instances cloned from &lt;foo&gt;.  So (isa? &lt;foo&gt; &lt;foo&gt;) returned
true, but the &quot;class&quot; &lt;foo&gt; did not obey the contracts of an &quot;instance&quot;
of &lt;foo&gt;.

So a variable of type &lt;foo&gt; could hold either &quot;subclasses&quot; of &lt;foo&gt; or
&quot;instances&quot; of &lt;foo&gt;.  This had lots of weird consequences, and made
some of our code smell funny.

Now, you could work around this by making sure that the &quot;class&quot; &lt;foo&gt;
was also an &quot;instance&quot; of &lt;foo&gt;.  This is quite easy for &lt;rectangle&gt;
(just set all the co-ordinates to 0), but rather awkward for
&lt;input-stream&gt; (what input should it return?).

2. We wanted first-class types.

Goo, like Dylan, makes extensive use of types.  You can dispatch on
them, instantiate them, introspect them, and use them in variable
declarations.

Since types are a major, first-class abstraction in Goo, we wanted to
have such classes as &lt;type&gt;, &lt;class&gt;, etc.  But since you can't tell
classes from instances in a prototype-based language, these abstractions
never work right.

In short: &quot;Dog&quot; isn't a dog.  The furry thing wandering down the hall is
a dog.  &quot;Dog&quot; is a word, or a platonic category, or a biological
classification.  But none of these things have long floppy ears and a
tail.

Prototype-based languages are simple and easy to program.  And if you
have no more of a type model than SmallTalk, you probably don't even pay
any conceptual penalty.  But once you start having type declarations and
first-class types, prototypes blur a useful distinction.

So it's basically a matter of taste, and consistency with other parts of
the language design.  (Language design is not an especially orthogonal
problem--too many features interact in surprising ways.)

Cheers,
Eric
