I'm (jb) forwarding this message from Alexander S A Kjeldaas:

Hi, I'm new to this list, and new to the goo language, but from what
I've read it looks like an interesting language.  Good job!

&gt;From reading the mailing list archives I see that you have been
discussing how threads could be implemented in goo.  From my
experience with implementing threaded applications, there are two
types of communication you need between threads.  One is the RPC type
of communication that jonathan prefers, and the other is &quot;shared
memory&quot; - data structures that are shared between processes.  I think
basing goo threads on RPC + &quot;shared memory&quot; would fill my needs.
However, having only RPC wouldn't be good enough.  I think a simple
example explains the issue.

It is often necessary to know the time of day (gettimeofday is one of
the most popular system calls).  Having a separate thread that updates
a shared memory area with the time of day every second can increase
performance.  The whole idea is to _not_ have to synchronize with
another process/thread, so if doing a RPC involves a context switch
you could just as well do the gettimeofday system call.

Some ideas wrt &quot;shared memory&quot;

o I think that in a lot of cases, the shared memory can be read only
for most threads, and only writeable for a single thread - if that
helps.  Usually one thread does most of the writing anyways, and you
can always get it to write stuff for you using RPC.

o Tables usually don't need to refer to objects outside the shared
memory area.  Enforcing a restriction like this shouldn't be a problem
(in most parallell C programs you don't have pointers in shared memory
anyways) should help GC a lot.

o There was a thread about &quot;server programming&quot; on comp.lang.lisp
where I argued that a programming language for servers should (even if
it is single threaded) support &quot;heaps&quot; where the language enforces how
objects in different heaps can refer to each other.  This is useful
even in a single threaded application where you have N network
connections being serviced simultaneously in an event-driven fashion.
When a request has been serviced, you want to tear down the heap where
you allocated all the objects associated with that request.  By
servicing the request within a &quot;heap&quot; that only exports objects
through RPC, this can be achieved and it virtually eliminates the need
for GC.  This leads me to believe that maybe &quot;heaps&quot; should be a lower
level abstraction than &quot;processes&quot; - that it should be possible to
create &quot;heaps&quot; without creating a process.

Also I want to comment on the need and the cost of supporting native
threads.  I definitively think a new programming language _needs_ to
support multiple CPUs in some way.  Already today, because of the ever
increasing gap between the CPU speed and memory latency, Intel is
making chips that pretend to be two separate CPUs so that two
processes can be interleaved.  In a very short time, we will all have
desktop CPUs where we can run two processes at basically the price of
one.  There is a limit to the parallelism we can extract from
programs, so the natural way forward is for the CPU to run several
programs simultaneously.  Languages that do not deal wih this will
lag behind. Languages that are well designed for this will benefit.

Then one last comment.  It was mentioned here that one might have to
pay with an extra indirection in the multi method dispatch in order to
update a method atomically.  This is probably not needed.  I haven't
read the goo source so this might be wrong, but let med just throw out
some ideas for pay-as-you-go strategies:

A method/function can be atomically updated by an atomic
cmpare-and-exchange instruction.  You simply overwrite the first
instruction of the old method with a jump to the new method. [On newer
intel CPUs this is easy because you have a 8-byte compare-and-exchange
instruction (a long jump is 6 bytes) - on older CPUs you need a local
jump so you need to set aside space for a trampoline nearby the
function].

After having updated the old method you can update dispatch tables at
various places in the code - but those updates now only need to be
individually atomic operations.

To update a generic function with a new method you could overwrite the
first instruction of the method an &quot;old&quot; multi-method dispatch would
end up in.  You could then dynamically add some code that would divert
to the new method if the types matched the new method signature.
