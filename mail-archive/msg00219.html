&gt; 
&gt; No need to worry about bothering me!  I'm quite happy that anyone is
&gt; trying to use SamurUI at all.  I apologize for not responding; I
&gt; actually read it and then started to talk to Jonathan about what you
&gt; said, then I promptly got distracted by something and ran off.  If I
&gt; fail to respond in the future, feel free to remind me as many times as
&gt; needed :)
&gt; 
&gt; Your request to be able to invoke Goo with some command-line arguments
&gt; is reasonable; I'll see what I can do to get Jonathan to add that.
&gt; However, in the meantime, you can pipe some stuff into Goo to
&gt; accomplish what you desire.  Specifically, you would do the following:
&gt; 
&gt; echo &quot;(use mystyff/test/foo)&quot; | ./g2c
&gt; 
&gt; We are hoping to clean up the development process for UI's so that
&gt; quitting isn't required (or at least recommended) so much.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't think (present &quot;Hello World&quot;) is going to work anytime soon.
&gt; To be honest, I'm not sure why it doesn't work; I think the problem is
&gt; that it is assuming that your presented object will have an
&gt; interface-view (iview) associated with it, but my quick perusal of the
&gt; code prompted by your e-mail suggested it should not have an issue
&gt; with that.  In general, however, the SamurUI strategy is to bind
&gt; things through getters and setters, which would preclude passing in
&gt; constants in most cases.  I agree it would make a cute hello-world,
&gt; but I'm generally wary of languages/UI's claiming everything important
&gt; can be done in one line of code (or less!).
&gt; 
&gt; All of your 4 &quot;How can I's&quot; are quite reasonable, but I'm going to
&gt; turn all of them around again and ask you what you're trying to do,
&gt; rather than just assume that you should be able to directly call all
&gt; of those things.
&gt; 
&gt; SamurUI has a number of layers going on:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Traditional GUI Layer.  Constructs windows, buttons, etc.  Binds
&gt;    callbacks to buttons etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) SamurUI the magic factory with default bindings.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the questions you ask seem to operate in the #1 space, which
&gt; I'm only really building because I need it to do my artsy, dubiously
&gt; useful #2 stuff.  Basically, I guess I'm trying to reinvent CLIM
&gt; without knowing all the stuff CLIM did, and certainly without trying
&gt; to put in the same level of effort.  Addressing your specific points:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) The only reason I could see to modify a label is if you were using
&gt;    it as a feedback mechanism.  For example, a label in a status-bar,
&gt;    etc.  Running with my current design style, it seems that I should
&gt;    internalize status/feedback mechanisms.  The mechanism could work
&gt;    in a similar fashion to the way master/slave communication works.
&gt;    Specifically, you would create a feedback object (ex: progress bar,
&gt;    label, etc.) by providing the default feedback 0 or &quot;&quot; I suppose,
&gt;    and then giving the communications channel it should use a name.
&gt;    When you create an object that presumably will have or emit
&gt;    feedback, you wrap it with a communications channel to use.  A
&gt;    rudimentary example:
&gt; 
&gt; (imethod &lt;app&gt; copy-something me ...
&gt;         ...
&gt;         (emit-status (/ i 100.0))
&gt;     )
&gt; 
&gt; (iview &lt;app&gt; 
&gt;    (columns &quot;Copy Progress: &quot; (slave-status 0.0 copy-progress))
&gt;    (master-status copy-something)
&gt;    )
&gt; 
&gt; 2) So I actually should create these at least for the thing GTK
&gt;    wrapping first, but let's get to how these fit into the SamurUI
&gt;    world.  For files, colors, and fonts, it seems that what should be
&gt;    happening is that I should be defining default bindings that
&gt;    trigger these, as well as base classes as needed.  So I would
&gt;    create a &lt;document-file&gt; class, that would bind to a text-box with
&gt;    a &quot;browse&quot; button that brings up the file dialog.  The actual
&gt;    opening and saving would be done by you... you'd just have the
&gt;    filename.  I'll cave and say that we should have a way to trigger
&gt;    the dialog though, which would probably be just the think GTK
&gt;    wrapping way.  Colors and fonts would be same deal... there would
&gt;    be a default binding for displayed color and font objects, but
&gt;    again, there will be direct methods you can call if you just want a
&gt;    font or color returned.
&gt; 
&gt; 3) There's obviously a need for this, but I would appreciate knowing
&gt;    what it is you want to do with these.  You can probably (present
&gt;    ...) multiple times right now and get multiple top level windows.
&gt;    In fact, you can probably present while it's running and create new
&gt;    ones on the fly.  A new modal-present could probably be introduced
&gt;    which would work similarly to present, except of course the window
&gt;    that appears would be modal.  (And could be called in a method, or
&gt;    what have you.)
&gt; 

&gt; 4) Again, there needs to be a way to do this with the thin GTK
&gt;    wrapping which will be done in a pseudo-getter-setter technique,
&gt;    but the SamurUI proper solution would ideally not involve this kind
&gt;    of procedural GUI control.  I suppose the way I see this going is
&gt;    to use the constraints interface (which is currently supposed to
&gt;    let you bound spin-boxes for numbers) to let you specify that a
&gt;    given control should only be active under certain situations.  That
&gt;    would presumably cover the case you have in mind.  Of course, I
&gt;    want to avoid making the &quot;elegant&quot; approach much harder and
&gt;    laborious a process to use than just programatically calling (set
&gt;    (gui-enabled bob) #f).  Of course, a little extra work might be in
&gt;    order, given that properly stating the constraints that express
&gt;    whether or not a control should be enabled can save you big, and
&gt;    works a lot better than having you code enabling disabling code all
&gt;    over the place.  (And it's good abstraction too I suppose; keeping
&gt;    the interface code in the (rapidly growing) interface-view.)
&gt; 
&gt; Er, so I think that covers it all.  I should note that I'm probably
&gt; not going to be able to get to most of these things for 1.5 - 2 weeks,
&gt; and that you should feel free to implement anything you want and send
&gt; it to me.  I probably will be somewhat fussy about things I put in the
&gt; 'fancy' SamurUI proper, but anything that adds functionality will
&gt; definitely go in the thin GTK wrapping.  (Which sounds like what you
&gt; are looking for primarily anyways.)
&gt; 
Not necessarily.  These are just the things I'm looking for in a gui library :-)
It's just that it is more easy to think in convential gui terms instead of thinking 
of the conceptually easier but also more unusual samurui ways :-)

By the way at the moment I haven't got Internet at home though it will maybe take me some more time to answer / react to your emails.

Cheers

Bene
