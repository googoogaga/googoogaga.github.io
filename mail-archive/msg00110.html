&gt; Resending this e-mail because majordomo had problems:
&gt; 
&gt; Most important is #1:
&gt; 1. Many programmers prefer mod:name over (use)ing everything into the
&gt; namespace.  
&gt; The problem with mod:name as it is is that directories can pile up:
&gt; (foo/bar/baz/math:sin foo/bar/baz/math:$pi)
&gt; 
&gt; Even a simple goo/math:$pi is a pain to type.
&gt; 
&gt; My proposal is this:
&gt; If the programmer types: (use goo/math)  , it imports everything as it
&gt;   does now.
&gt; If the programmer types: (use goo/math math)  , the second argument
&gt;   becomes the shortened version and then the programmer can type
&gt;   math:$pi

that seems reasonable.  there are other deficiencies of the current
minimal module system such as no renaming, no set operations (i.e.,
selective importation), absolutely no circularities.  

&gt; This would replace the current mod:name system (because of possible
&gt; name clashing).

how would this replace it and what name clashes are you referring to?

&gt; 2. Why not replace swapf with Common Lisp's rotatef, which is
&gt; generally more useful?

just trying to keep things simple, but i see your point.

&gt; 3. Chris Armstrong's nitpick: Why is string formatting tied to ports?

for efficiency.

&gt; It'd be nice if there was a function ('format' maybe?) that returned
&gt; a formatted string the way (msg) prints them.

  (df format (str|&lt;str&gt; args|... =&gt; &lt;str&gt;)
    (port2str port (app msg port str args)))

&gt; (msg) could still exist as a shortened version of (write port (format))

but then you're going cons a string unless you have a much smarter
compiler.

there definitely needs more work on printing.  i'll think more about
this.

&gt; 4. We need a slicing function for sequences (I couldn't find one...).
&gt; 'slice' is a good name IMHO... we could possibly use _ to indicate
&gt; either the end or beginning of the array.  For instance:
&gt; (slice array 1 _) to slice from 1 -&gt; end.  (Or use Python's -1?)

it's called 'sub'.  i do like the python's -1 but that does
potentially mask real indexing errors.  it's probably worth the
convenience though.

&gt; Also, an optional third argument for step size would be nice.

sure.

&gt; 5. Two things are incorrect on the web:
&gt; Example for DS should use 'unless' and not 'when'

yep.

&gt; (empty) has an incorrect signature

yep.

&gt; 6. Why is DS like: (ds (macro ,blah ,@asdf)) and not like:
&gt; (ds macro (,blah ,@asdf))?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems inconsistent with DF and DM.

i see your point.  i was trying to make it somewhat wysiwyg but then i
could have done the same with DF's looking more like calls (as is done
in scheme with define).

&gt; 7. *-setter seems too long.  *! or *-set or *-set! may be better names.

reasonable.

&gt; 8. Some destructive functions don't have a !, such as set.

having set not have a ! was intentional.  wanted it to be short.

what other functions do you have in mind?

&gt; 9. Bugs: dv always returns #f.  push is broken for lists.
&gt; 
&gt; 10. Will we be able to import from the directory in which goo is run in
&gt; the future?
&gt; 
&gt; 11. According to wiki, default values will look like:
&gt; (dm function (a:0|&lt;int&gt; b:1|&lt;int&gt;))
&gt; 
&gt; It may be just me, but I think default values should be consistent with
&gt; rep's and let's variable assignments.
&gt; 
&gt; So, maybe make default values look like:
&gt; (dm function ((a 0)|&lt;int&gt; (b 0)|&lt;int&gt;))
&gt; 
&gt; Or change let/rep to look like:
&gt; (let (x:0 y:3))

nice.

&gt; 12. Functions like (trunc/) should IMO return one value.  If the
&gt; programmer wanted a remainder, they would use (mod)

that's probably a reasonable suggestion.  

&gt; It could still return one value, but be able to assign two much like
&gt; Common Lisp's multiple-value-bind.

but that's another thing altogether.  

&gt; That's about it.. so far :)

thanks a bunch for your suggestions and comments.
