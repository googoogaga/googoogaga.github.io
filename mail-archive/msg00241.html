goo 0_153 is now available from www.googoogaga.org along with v44 of
the goo doc.  many changes have been made since 0_146 including a
number of internal changes to the vm, analysis, and optimization which
are still currently disabled.  other speed improvements are available
including runtime tweaks and loop optimizations which make the current
release significantly faster than 0_146.  there are a few new features
and one incompatible change in the syntax of macro definitions.

i am thinking about changing a few things more that would require
existing code to be modified, but i wanted to get a release out asap.
the changes i have in mind are to change:

  o the -setter suffix to -set
  o file access to signal a condition on eof
  o object printing to use a to-doc protocol allowing pretty printing etc

included below is the long list of changes.

happy new year.
