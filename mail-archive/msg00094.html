I throw my code under my goo 'src' directory.  James pointers are
probably more consistent with regards to how goo likes to be
structured, but I find that if you brutalize the Makefile, and symlink
$GOO_ROOT/mods to $GOO_ROOT/src (and $GOO_ROOT/lib to $GOO_ROOT/c),
things work out fairly nicely.

In terms of building code, I've got a few different mix of strategies
going on depending on the modules involved.  First, it should be noted
that James is living in the past vis-a-vis the SWIG'ed stuff; since
Goo v140 (thanks to Jonathan) I've been able to statically compile and
link my GTK SWIG bindings in, and my GUI layer as well.  (This is done
by adding the relevant uses to src/eval/main, then g2c-top'ing a new
image after using (g2c-test #) followed by make sub=g2c-# to make sure
I don't thrash my primary image.)

Then, as I develop things that use the GUI layer, I tend to just 'use'
the application module, let it dynamically compile everything, and see
how it goes.  Once it fails, I bail out of goo and go back in again; I
know that's against the spirit of interactive programming, but:

1) The GUI layer sadly has no clean way to re-initialize its state and
   the GTK's state (some day...)

2) Once a module is succesfully use'd, goo won't let you re-use it;
   it'll just bypass loading the module.  This means that you'll end
   you having to use &quot;,in module&quot; to get into the proper module and
   enter the proper redefinitions to the repl.  One alternative to
   that problem is to just use (load &quot;blah&quot;) instead, and keep
   everything in goo/user.  In any event, as long as the modules
   you're using aren't too big, you have a fast machine, and you've
   statically compiled in the constant stuff, it's generally just
   faster/easier to exit goo, re-enter, and 'use' again.

So that's how I develop things that build on the GUI.  The core GUI
layer was developed before we could statically link things in, so that
was all done dynamically, but it's my intention now to stick with
statically compiling that portion because the incremental changes
should be small and static compilation catches typo's and other
stupidity because the bindings are done statically.  If you don't
close the goo image that you g2c-top from, if you run g2c-top again,
it will only rebuild the .goo files which have changed, making its
speed comparable to dynamic compilation.  The big win again is that
you don't discover 2-seconds into your run after a 1-minute
compilation that you made a typo, thus requiring another compile.
(The core GUI development would be a great place to be doing the
incremental dev stuff, but I need to put some legwork in to get that
to happen, and it's just one of those things where it just hasn't
seemed like the hassle is worth it yet.)

In summary, ideally you want to keep your modules small, and
statically compile in those things that hold constant.  Then you can
dynamically compile the stuff that you're working on, and generally
not even have to worry about pasting in new definitions.  In your
case, since you have a big functional background, I'm sure you're all
about keeping the image live and just pasting in new definitions, but
I'm lazy and paranoid about getting hassled by odd side effects of
dynamicly updating core bits of code.

I use emacs, but for no good reason, I don't use the goo inferior
mode.  If we hack in GNU readline that should be less of an issue, but
the inferior mode is nice.

Hope this wasn't too much of a rant and was helpful.  There are a few
useful compilation hints scattered in there at least.

Andrew
